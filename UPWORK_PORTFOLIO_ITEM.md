## Summary (~150 words)

A self-hosted AI engine that businesses configure instead of commissioning. Each client is a folder
of config files: hard facts (hours, prices, services), documents, scoring rules and reply templates.
From that, the engine answers customer questions with checkable citations and never invents a price
or opening time, books real appointments into the business's Google Calendar and emails the
confirmation, runs an ElevenLabs voice receptionist built from the same config, puts a chat widget
(with a call button) on any website with one script tag, runs the same assistant as a Telegram bot,
turns forwarded emails and contact forms into leads, and scores them with an LLM checked by a
deterministic TypeScript policy gate. The team works from one inbox across every channel, can take
over a chat live, and gets alerts, reminders and a signed webhook into any CRM. Every decision is
audit-logged per client. Security is tested, not assumed: injection detectors, tenant isolation
between every client pair, SSRF-safe ingestion, signed webhooks, per-visitor caps on anything that costs.

## Measured on the live system

- Lead qualification p50 2.8 s / p95 4.2 s, with a fallback chain and a review route instead of errors
- Deterministic policy gate ≈ 10 ms, no model call
- Voice tools p95 ≈ 25 ms
- Real voice call test 17/17 (docs question, two injection attempts, book + cancel, signed webhook stored)
- Chat turn 1–4 ms when code handles it, 1.3–3.7 s with the router model
- 789 static checks, 102 per-client live tests, 32/32 held-out support questions, 42 chat, 15 forms,
  5 calendar, 21 voice, 90 app checks

## Highlights for proposals

- Hard facts come from config, never from the model; out-of-scope questions are refused.
- Explainable decisions: score, per-gate pass/fail and reason codes for every lead.
- Adding a client is configuration, not development.
- Channels plug into what the business already has: one script tag, a form URL, an email forward,
  a Telegram bot, its own calendar and phone number.
- Human handoff: the owner replies live into the visitor's chat from one inbox.
- GDPR erasure by anonymisation; signed webhooks into any CRM or a Google Sheet.
- Runs on the client's own server (installer with upgrades and rollback) or hosted; the client owns its data.
